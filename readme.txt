== Description ==

**Provide your visitors a Flash equivalent of your website / Convert your WordPress blog into a Flash application.**

Wordpress plugin can turn any blog or website powered by WordPress into a full Flash site, combining advantages of HTML, Flash and Silex technologies.

The original WordPress site remains visible to those who do not have the Flash plugin or wish to see the HTML version. For mobile phones, another WordPress theme is displayed automatically (iphone, windows mobile). Finally, for optimal SEO, search engines will see an optimized HTML version of the site.

Since the Flash version has deep linking, the permalinks are valid, they are shared by the HTML and the Flash versions. The selection of the Flash theme is made in the WordPress settings page, and the themes are editable with Silex WYSIWYG, without programming skills and without Flash CSx. 

* visible only by Flash enabled browsers - *search engines or portable phones will see your blog theme*
* keeps the *posts and comments* of your WP blog unchanged. The database is not modified at all. Keeps comments related functionnalities.
* keeps *the structure of your WP blog*: posts, categories, tags, pages, archives, start page...
* use WP URL rewrite and adds a *deep linking system*
* choose one of the *included Flash templates* from the admin pannel
* create your own dynamic Flash templates with *Silex WYSIWYG*
* compatible with **WordPress Mu**

**Description**

flog is SEO friendly and makes use of [Silex the #1 opensource Flash CMS](http://silex-ria.org/ "Silex project website"), to build dynamic Flash templates without the Flash IDE. These templates can display your blog data, the posts, pages and comments. And you will be able to modify the appearance in [Silex WYSIWYG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzFqfuiLQ4k&hl=fr "Silex WYSIWYG video demo").

[Sha](http://silex-ria.org/sha "Sha cv") has allready done [a website with Silex driven by WordPress](http://flashcms.fr/ "flashcms, a Silex-WP site (in French)"). And [here is a video of an other test I did](http://www.screentoaster.com/watch/stUkxdQ0VLR15cR19dU1le "Silex Wordpress video")). These prototypes are not SEO friendly and a classical WordPress blog could not be converted easily. 

Now I want flog to let Silex themes be Flash equivalents of WordPress themes.
 
== Installation ==

Upload the flog plugin to your blog, Activate it, choose your Flash template. You are done, Your blog is in Flash

Requirements

* php5
* WP 2.x
